  <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question"">
      <strong>Q: How do I install the Square Bermuda Megaflex™ floor waste?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">
      A: Installation is straightforward—ensure the ABS Megaflex™ base is securely connected to your drainage pipe. Remove the protective cover after tiling is complete, and set the waste into place. Always follow Australian plumbing codes for compliant installation.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question"">
      <strong>Q: What is the maximum flow rate this floor waste can handle?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">
      A: The Square Bermuda Megaflex™ 100x100mm Floor Waste is tested to a maximum flow rate of 50 litres per minute with a 5mm head of water and a minimum fall to waste of 1:80, though real-world flow may vary based on installation and water delivery systems.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question"">
      <strong>Q: Is the floor waste compatible with all tile types?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">
      A: Yes, it’s compatible with most floor tiles, including ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone. Ensure the tile thickness accommodates the flange depth and allows for proper drainage slope to the waste.

<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
<p>RLA 2PART is a technically advanced, two-component waterproofing membrane comprising a liquid polymer (Part A) and a cement-based powder (Part B). This combination delivers a superior balance of flexibility and strength. The 1:1 mixing ratio simplifies preparation, and the resulting viscous paste is easy to apply by brush or roller. Achieving the specified dry film thickness (DFT) of 1.2mm is critical for optimal performance, requiring a minimum two-coat application with a total coverage of 1.5 litres/m².</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Properties:</strong> Cementitious, providing excellent adhesion and compatibility with cement-based substrates and tile adhesives.</p>
<p><strong>Application Temperature Range:</strong> Apply only when the substrate and ambient temperatures are between 5°C and 35°C (41°F and 95°F). Applying outside this range can affect curing time and overall performance. For example, in hot weather, consider working during cooler parts of the day to extend pot life and prevent premature drying.</p>
<h3>Application Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Required Tools:</strong> Mixing drill with paddle attachment, brush or medium nap roller, wet film thickness gauge, scissors or knife (for cutting tape), spatula or roller (for pressing tape).</li>
<li>
<strong>Trade-Specific Tips:</strong> Always add the powder (Part B) to the liquid (Part A) while mixing. Allow the mixed product to stand for 5 minutes before use to ensure proper hydration. Regularly check the wet film thickness to guarantee adequate coverage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Common Issues and Solutions:</strong> If the membrane dries too quickly, reduce the application area or work during cooler periods. If pinholes appear, apply an additional thin coat. For substrate irregularities, use RLA repair compounds before applying the membrane.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Storage and Shelf Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Storage Requirements:</strong> Store in a dry area, off the ground, and out of direct sunlight.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shelf Life Information:</strong> 12 months from the date of production when stored in unopened original packaging.</li>
<li>
<strong>Temperature Considerations:</strong> Ensure storage temperature remains above 5°C (41°F).</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Surface Preparation:</strong> Ensure all surfaces are clean, sound, smooth, dry, and free from contaminants. Mechanically remove any unsound layers or contaminants. Fill any defects, voids, or cracks.</li>
  <li><strong>Priming:</strong> Apply the appropriate RLA primer based on the substrate's porosity: RLA Porous Primer for porous surfaces (1-2 coats), RLA Non Porous Primer for non-porous surfaces (1 coat), or RLA Moisture Seal for damp surfaces (1-2 coats). Allow primer to dry completely.</li>
  <li><strong>Mixing:</strong> Pour half (10 litres) of Part A liquid into a clean 20L bucket. While mechanically stirring, slowly add one 10 kg bag of Part B powder and mix until smooth and lump-free. Allow to stand for 5 minutes and remix before use.</li>
  <li><strong>First Coat Application:</strong> Using a brush or medium nap roller, apply an even first coat to the surface, achieving a minimum wet film thickness of 0.75mm (750 micron).</li>
  <li><strong>Drying Time:</strong> Allow the first coat to dry completely, typically for 2-4 hours at 23°C and 50% RH. Drying times will vary with temperature and humidity.</li>
  <li><strong>Second Coat Application:</strong> Apply a second coat at a right angle to the first coat, again achieving a minimum wet film thickness of 0.75mm (750 micron). This will result in a total minimum dry film thickness of 1.2mm.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailing:</strong> Incorporate bond breaker tapes (e.g., Elastoproof Joint Band, BRW PF Tape) at all joints, junctions, and corners as per relevant Australian Standards (AS 3740 & AS 4654.1). Use Elastoproof Collars or BRW PF Tape for pipes and penetrations.</li>
  <li><strong>Curing:</strong> Allow the membrane to cure fully before tiling or applying toppings. Polymer-modified adhesives can typically be used after 24 hours. Immersion in water should be delayed for 7 days.</li>

<p>Gripset XpressLay Self Adhesive Waterproofing Sheet is a high-strength, reinforced PVC sheet designed for efficient waterproofing and anti-fracture applications. Its self-adhesive backing significantly speeds up installation, making it a preferred choice for tilers and waterproofers. This sheet provides excellent moisture and vapour resistance, safeguarding internal wet areas like bathrooms and laundries. For renovators and builders, its anti-fracture properties offer added protection to tiled surfaces over existing or cracked substrates. The versatility of Gripset XpressLay extends to various substrates, including concrete, timber, and existing tiles, streamlining material selection on site.</p>
<p><strong>Primer Information:</strong> Gripset XpressLay requires priming for optimal adhesion. Use RLA Universal Primer (diluted for porous surfaces, neat for non-porous) or Gripset E60 for green/damp surfaces. Priming ensures a strong bond, especially crucial for demanding wet area applications.</p>
<p><strong>Installation:</strong> The self-adhesive nature of XpressLay allows for quick and easy installation. Simply measure, cut, peel, and stick. Ensure overlaps are a minimum of 50mm and firmly rolled. For plumbers and tilers, this significantly reduces installation time compared to traditional methods.</p>
<p><strong>Thickness and Strength:</strong> At 1mm thick with a tensile strength of &gt;2MPa and elongation of &gt;60%, XpressLay provides a durable and flexible waterproofing layer. This is vital for preventing cracks in tiles due to substrate movement, a common concern for builders and homeowners.</p>

permabond-102-50g,Permabond 102 Cyanoacrylate Adhesive,"<div class=""quick-specs""><span class=""spec""><strong>Use Permabond 102 for:</strong> Rapid bonding of close-fitting plastic, rubber, and metal parts; high-speed assembly lines; quick repairs on small components.</span></div>
<div class=""product-description"">
<p>Permabond 102 is an ethyl cyanoacrylate adhesive renowned for its extremely fast fixture time and low viscosity. This colourless, single-component ""super glue"" polymerises rapidly through surface moisture, creating strong bonds on a wide variety of materials in mere seconds. Its low viscosity (70-90 cP) allows it to wick effectively into tight gaps (up to 0.15 mm or 0.006 in), making it perfect for precise bonding of close-fitting components. Australian manufacturers, repair technicians, model makers, and prototyping specialists rely on Permabond 102 for applications demanding speed and accuracy, especially when bonding plastics, rubbers (like Buna N), and metals.</p>
<p><strong>Primer Information:</strong> For optimal bonding on difficult low-surface-energy plastics such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), PTFE, or silicone rubber, pre-treatment of the surface with Permabond POP Polyolefin Primer is essential before applying Permabond 102.</p>
<p><strong>Activator Information:</strong> On porous surfaces, or in very low humidity conditions sometimes found in drier Australian regions, cure speed may slow. To ensure rapid fixturing in these situations, consider using Permabond CSA or QFS 16 activators.</p>
<p><strong>Cure Time:</strong> Permabond 102 achieves handling strength (fixture time) incredibly quickly: 5-10 seconds on Buna N Rubber, 7-10 seconds on ABS and PVC, and 10-15 seconds on Steel and Phenolic surfaces under typical conditions (23°C, 50% RH). This rapid cure dramatically speeds up assembly processes. Full mechanical strength develops within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Coverage Rate:</strong> As a cyanoacrylate, Permabond 102 is applied sparingly – typically one small drop per few square centimetres of bond area is sufficient. Coverage depends heavily on the application method and substrate smoothness, but a little goes a long way.</p>
<p><strong>Application Temperature Range:</strong> While the adhesive itself cures at ambient temperatures, the cured bond performs reliably in service temperatures ranging from -55°C to 80°C (-65°F to 176°F). It can withstand brief exposures to higher temperatures (e.g., paint baking cycles) if the joint isn't highly stressed, making it versatile for various manufacturing processes.</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Properties:</strong> Permabond 102 is an ethyl cyanoacrylate. It offers good resistance to non-polar solvents but is not recommended for prolonged exposure to strong oxidising materials or polar solvents. It will generally withstand a quick solvent wash without bond degradation, useful for cleaning processes post-assembly.</p>

<li>
<strong>Model Making:</strong> Use a 'kicker' or activator (CSA/QFS 16) sparingly if faster setting is needed, but be aware it can sometimes slightly reduce ultimate bond strength or cause hazing on clear plastics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Common Issues and Solutions (Australian Conditions):</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Curing Too Fast (High Humidity - e.g., Summer in QLD/NT):</strong> Align parts immediately after application. Work in smaller sections. Ensure adhesive isn't too warm.</li>
<li>
<strong>Curing Too Slow (Low Humidity - e.g., Arid zones, winter):</strong> Use Permabond CSA or QFS 16 activator on one surface. Ensure parts are clean and adhesive is fresh.</li>
<li>
<strong>White Haze ('Blooming'):</strong> Caused by rapid cure, especially with activators or excess adhesive. Ensure good airflow/ventilation during cure. Use minimal adhesive.</li>
<li>
<strong>Poor Bond Strength:</strong> Check surface cleanliness/preparation. Verify material type (use POP primer for PP/PE/PTFE/Silicone). Ensure parts are mated within the adhesive's open time and gap is minimal (&lt;0.15mm). Check adhesive age/storage conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Storage and Shelf Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Storage Requirements:</strong> Store unopened containers in a refrigerator at 2°C to 7°C (35°F to 45°F). This is critical for maintaining shelf life, especially in warmer Australian climates.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shelf Life Information:</strong> Shelf life data wasn't provided in the excerpt, but typically cyanoacrylates maintain properties best for 6-12 months under ideal refrigerated conditions. Check packaging for expiry date.</li>

<div class=""faq-container"">
  <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question""><strong>Q: How fast does Permabond 102 actually set? Can I reposition parts?</strong></p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">A: Permabond 102 sets extremely quickly, typically achieving handling strength in 5-15 seconds depending on the material. You have very little time for repositioning once parts make contact. Ensure accurate alignment *before* bringing surfaces together, especially in humid Australian conditions which can accelerate the cure.</p>
  </div>
  <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question""><strong>Q: Do I always need to use the POP primer for plastics?</strong></p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">A: No, Permabond 102 bonds well directly to many common plastics like ABS, PVC, Polycarbonate, and Phenolic. However, for low-surface-energy plastics like Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene (PE), PTFE (Teflon®), and Silicone rubber, you absolutely need to use Permabond POP Primer first to achieve a strong bond.</p>
  </div>
   <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question""><strong>Q: What's the best way to prepare surfaces before using Permabond 102?</strong></p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">A: Surfaces must be clean, dry, and free from grease or oil. Degrease using a suitable solvent like Isopropanol (IPA) or acetone. For metals like aluminium or copper, lightly abrading the surface with emery cloth to remove the oxide layer can improve bond strength. Ensure all solvent is evaporated before applying the adhesive.</p>
  </div>
   <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question""><strong>Q: Can I use Permabond 102 to fill gaps between parts?</strong></p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">A: No, Permabond 102 is very low viscosity and designed for tight-fitting parts with a maximum gap fill of only 0.15 mm (0.006 in). It will not effectively bridge larger gaps. For gap filling, consider a higher viscosity cyanoacrylate, a gel formulation, or a different adhesive technology like epoxy.</p>
  </div>
   <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question""><strong>Q: Why does the adhesive sometimes create a white residue (blooming)?</strong></p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">A: This 'blooming' or 'frosting' is common with cyanoacrylates and is caused by adhesive vapours reacting with moisture and settling on the surface during a rapid cure. It's more likely with excess adhesive, poor ventilation, or when using activators. Minimise adhesive use, ensure good airflow, and avoid excessive activator application.</p>
  </div>
  <div class=""faq-item"">
    <p class=""faq-question""><strong>Q: How critical is the refrigerated storage? What happens if I don't?</strong></p>
    <p class=""faq-answer"">A: Refrigerated storage (2-7°C) is critical for maximising shelf life, especially in Australia's often warm climate. Storing at room temperature significantly shortens the effective life of the adhesive, causing it to thicken or potentially cure prematurely in the bottle. Always allow it to reach room temp before opening.</p>
  </div>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Technical Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Efflock's unique technology creates a hydrophobic molecular structure within the pores of cured concrete without filling the pores of the material. This dramatically reduces water absorption while maintaining permeability. Efflock provides bulk impregnation, protecting concrete throughout its entire mass, ensuring that performance is not affected by traffic wear or movement cracks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Hydrophobic Properties:</strong> Imparts a water-repellent quality to cement-based materials, preventing water ingress and associated damage.
  </p>
  <p>

<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>Coverage rates may vary depending on the type, condition, porosity, texture of the surface, and application technique. The minimum coverage rate is 1.7L/m² or 0.85L/m² per coat. A 15 Lt pail will cover 18 m² for 1 coat at 0.5mm DFT. For water-resistant non-tanking walls, the minimum coverage is 0.85L/m² at 0.5mm DFT. The dry film thickness of the membrane on floors and tanking areas should be 1.0mm DFT with each coat being 500 microns dry film (0.5mm DFT).</p>
<h3>Drying and Curing</h3>
<p>Drying and curing times are affected by the type, dryness, and porosity of the surface, temperature, humidity, ventilation, climate conditions, and application technique. As a guide, at 25ºC and 50% RH, the touch dry time is 2 to 4 hours per coat, set time is 12 hours, and full cure time is 24 hours per coat. Ensure the membrane is fully cured before tiling or topping. Azcothane is generally touch dry within 2 to 4 hours and fully cured after 24 hours. Recoat between 4-24 hours.</p>
<h3>Clean-up</h3>
<p>Avoid spills. Wet spills can be cleaned with water, but they may be difficult to clean on porous surfaces. On concrete and non-porous surfaces, use a cloth and water for wet spills. Do not clean off carpets as it is better to allow the product to cure and then shave the carpet. Equipment should be immediately cleaned with water.</p>

<div class=""product-description"">
<p>Mountain Grout Flexible is a single-component, hydrophobic polyurethane grout designed for professional concrete repair. Its low viscosity allows for deep penetration into cracks and joints, expanding up to 30 times its initial volume upon contact with minimal water. This expansion creates a closed-cell foam that forms a flexible, durable, and watertight seal, ideal for various applications, including water-related facilities, tunnels, and underground vaults. The addition of the ""B"" accelerator allows for job site control of the reaction time.</p>
<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hydrophobic: Forms a watertight seal.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Installing BRW Swell Seal Waterstop:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be installed directly onto the concrete surface or to a formed channel in the concrete</li>
<li>Optimum results achieved by applying Swell Seal onto even smooth surfaces. Undulating surfaces may slow the application.</li>
<li>Ensure a 50mm cover from the edge of the concrete to the face of the Swell Seal to prevent any concrete blow-outs.</li>
<li>Swell Seal should be positioned between two rows of reinforcing steel to support optimum product placement.</li>
<li>Joint surfaces must be free of loose dirt, dust, and debris.</li>
<li>Place Swell Seal in position, and remove release backing from the adhesive side in small sections.</li>

It is crucial to apply the product within the temperature range of 10ºC to 35ºC, and curing requires a temperature exceeding 10ºC and relative humidity below 85%. Adequate ventilation and heating should be utilized when curing conditions are not met.</p>
<h3>Benefits and Advantages:</h3>
<p>Primeseal MC boasts several benefits, making it a user and environmentally friendly choice. It is solvent-free with negligible odor and meets the 'Green Star' environmental criteria. The membrane can be applied to damp and newly laid concrete surfaces, acting as a barrier against low water vapor pressure. Primeseal MC is suitable for contact with potable (drinking) water and is non-toxic and non-flammable, making it safe for sensitive areas. It offers excellent water barrier properties and adheres well to most existing coatings.</p>
<h3>Coverage and Drying:</h3>
<p>The coverage of Primeseal MC varies depending on the surface and application technique. As an effective waterproofing membrane, a minimum of 2 coats applied at 3m² per litre per coat is recommended, with a dry film thickness of 0.33mm. Drying and curing times are influenced by various factors, including temperature and humidity. It is essential to allow the membrane to achieve full cure before applying subsequent treatments or coatings.</p>",Duram,Uncategorized,Epoxy,,False,Colour,Light Grey,,Size,20L Kit,,,,,PRIMESEAL/20,27160.0,shopify,continue,manual,316.77,,True,True,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0507/3630/0224/products/Duram-Primeseal-Image.png?v=1741660267,1.0,,False,Duram Primeseal MC - Water-Based Epoxy Barrier Membrane,"Duram Primeseal MC is a water-based epoxy barrier membrane, perfect for waterproofing and sealing damp and newly laid concrete surfaces.

    Azcoseal is a premium clear acrylic sealer and primer designed for deep penetration into porous substrates like concrete, masonry, pavers, and FC sheeting. It cures to form a tough, resilient, semi-gloss (wet-look) finish that enhances appearance while providing a long-lasting weatherproof barrier. Ideal for use as a stand-alone sealer or primer under Duram waterproofing membranes and coatings, Azcoseal is UV-resistant, quick-drying, and suitable for encapsulating friable surfaces like asbestos. Its cross-linking technology ensures excellent bonding, and its low-modulus formula ensures thorough substrate penetration. Perfect for Australian trades working with concrete, masonry, or decorative surfaces.

primer-g,Mapei Primer G,"<h3>Mapei Primer G</h3>
<p>Mapei Primer G is a high-quality synthetic resin-based water-dispersion primer with very low volatile organic compound (VOC). It serves multiple purposes, including treating gypsum surfaces before installing ceramic tiles, acting as an anchoring coat for gypsum-based sprayable plasters, and improving the adhesion of smoothing compounds on cementitious, anhydrite, and gypsum-based surfaces.</p>
<p>The primer provides uniform absorption on cementitious or gypsum surfaces, making it an ideal choice for various applications. It creates a flexible, compact, and shiny coating on any surface, consolidating it where needed. Primer G enhances the adhesion of smoothing compounds, paint, adhesive for wallpaper, adhesive for tiles, and mortar for renders.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of Primer G is its ability to prevent chemical reactions between sulphates and the cement alluminates of gypsum, which can lead to the formation of the salt ""ettringite"" and cause separation. By reducing substrate absorption, it makes wallpaper removal easier when used for papering. Additionally, when applied before sprayable plasters or self-levelling compounds, Primer G helps prevent over-rapid absorption of water, prolonging workability time and minimizing shrinkage cracks.</p>
<p>This non-flammable primer can be used in closed, unventilated environments without any special precautions. However, it's important not to apply Primer G in such quantity that it forms a surface film; dilute with water as appropriate for the substrate's absorption.</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Primer G does not waterproof gypsum substrates but considerably reduces their porosity and absorption.</li>
<li>Avoid applying onto magnesium substrates.</li>
<li>Not recommended for external applications or where rising damp is present.</li>
<li>Do not use in excess to form a surface film; dilute appropriately for the substrate's absorption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<p>Tools and containers should be washed with clean water immediately after use. Any remaining residues, once dry, must be removed mechanically or with Pulicol 2000.</p>
<h3>Consumption</h3>
<p>The consumption of Primer G depends on the porosity and absorption of the surface, with normal consumption ranging between 0.08 and 0.15 kg/m².</p>
<h3>Packaging</h3>
<p>Primer G is available in 25 kg, 10 kg, and 5 kg plastic drums, as well as 1 kg bottles.</p>
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>Primer G, in its original unopened packaging, can be stored for 12 months. Protect from frost.</p>",Mapei,Uncategorized,Primers,,False,Colours,Light Blue,,Size,25kg,,,,,PRIMEG/25,191.7,shopify,continue,manual,236.15,,True,True,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0507/3630/0224/files/Mapei-Primer-G.jpg?v=1741660278,1.0,,False,Mapei Primer G - Synthetic Resin-Based Water-Dispersion Primer,"Discover Mapei Primer G, a top-quality synthetic resin-based water-dispersion primer with very low VOC.

<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
<p>Adheseal S100 Kitchen &amp; Bathroom Silicone Sealant is formulated to provide a permanently elastic and dustproof joint seal. Its neutral curing system ensures compatibility with various substrates, while its anti-fungal properties prevent mould growth. The high elasticity and UV stability make it suitable for both internal and external applications.</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Properties:</strong> Polysiloxane-based sealant with an oxime curing system. Provides excellent resistance to mould and mildew.</p>
<p><strong>Application Temperature Range:</strong> +5°C to +35°C (41°F to 95°F). Ensure surfaces are clean and dry for optimal adhesion. Cure time is approximately 2mm per day at 25°C (77°F) and 50% humidity.</p>
<h3>Application Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Required Tools:</strong> Caulking gun, spatula, masking tape, cleaning cloths, and appropriate cleaners/solvents (e.g., white spirits).</li>
<li>
<strong>Trade-Specific Tips:</strong> Use a backing rod for joints deeper than 10mm to control depth and ensure proper adhesion. Apply sealant in a continuous bead and tool off with a moistened spatula before skin formation. Mask joint edges for a neater finish and remove tape while the sealant is still wet.</li>
<li>
<strong>Common Issues and Solutions:</strong> Incomplete curing can occur in totally confined spaces; ensure adequate atmospheric humidity.
