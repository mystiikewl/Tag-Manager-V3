# Progress

## Current Status

- Canonical Memory Bank initialized:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md (with roadmap and work queue)
- Pending helper inventories:
  - systemInventory.md (module roles and dependencies)
  - apiContracts.md (current endpoints and response shapes)

## What Works Today (High-Level)

- FastAPI backend serving product/category data with SQLite storage.
- Frontend vanilla JS modules with Tailwind and Vite build.
- UI supports browsing products, assigning/removing categories, and CSV export.
- Utilities available for DB initialization/migration and category sync.

## Known Issues / Risks

- Parallel MSI vs non-MSI module variants may cause divergence and confusion.
- Inconsistent API response/error formats versus desired standard.
- Ad hoc DOM mutations and cross-module coupling in some areas.
- Validation fragmented between frontend and backend.
- Duplicated utilities and inconsistent naming patterns.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Create systemInventory.md
   - Catalog static/js by layer (core, services, domain services, managers, modules, components, events, utils).
   - Note primary responsibilities and key dependencies.
2. Create apiContracts.md
   - Extract current endpoints from app.py.
   - Document current request/response/error shapes for later alignment with api-patterns.mdc.
3. Decide approach for MSI vs non-MSI consolidation
   - Prefer single canonical module set; deprecate duplicates with migration notes.
4. Define eventManager contract reference
   - List canonical event names and payload structures (publish/subscribe).

## Milestones

- M1: Inventories completed (systemInventory.md, apiContracts.md).
- M2: API contract hardened with Pydantic models and consistent error format.
- M3: State management consolidated; all fetches via ApiService/CategoryService; event-driven UI enforced.
- M4: UI componentization standardized; destructive flows confirmed via modals.
- M5: Test coverage for core flows; CI-ready lint/format/build/test commands.

## Blockers

- None identified currently. Awaiting inventories to expose hidden coupling or API gaps.

## Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility for existing CSV export and product/category operations during refactor phases.
- Keep documentation updated per milestone completion.
