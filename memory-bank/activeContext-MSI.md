  - **üîß Technical Implementation Completed:**
    - **CategoryManager Integration (`static/js/core/init.js`):**
      - Imported `CategoryManager` module.
      - Instantiated `new CategoryManager()` within `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to activate new modal features.
    - **Category Creation Modal Fix (`static/js/components/modals/CategoryCreationModal.js`):**
      - Updated `handleLevelChange` function to correctly validate the selected category level using `validateCategoryLevel`.
      - Ensured `this.validationState.level` is updated based on validation result.

- **üîß Refinement**: Remove debug logging once functionality is confirmed stable.
- **üì± Mobile Testing**: Verify enhanced UI works correctly across all device sizes.

## Key Patterns & Learnings

- **Event Handling Best Practices**: Always add both click and change event listeners for interactive elements.
- **Visual Feedback Importance**: Users need immediate visual confirmation of button clicks and form state changes.
- **Debug Logging Strategy**: Comprehensive console logging critical for troubleshooting complex UI interactions.
- **Auto-scroll UX Pattern**: Form opening should include auto-scroll and visual highlighting for better UX.
- **Button State Management**: Loading states and temporary disabling prevent user confusion and UI conflicts.
- **Validation State Synchronization**: Ensure UI validation state (`this.validationState`) is correctly updated by validation functions to enable/disable submit buttons.
- **Consistent User Messaging**: UI messages (especially warnings/errors) must accurately reflect system behavior to avoid user confusion.

### Latest Session Insights (2025-07-29)

- **Modal Validation Logic**: Critical to ensure all form fields correctly update the modal's internal validation state for the submit button to enable.
- **UI Consistency**: Warning messages should align with backend validation rules to provide accurate user guidance.
- **Centralized Management**: `CategoryManager` effectively orchestrates modal initialization and event handling, simplifying integration.

### Active Patterns & Preferences

- **Direct Tree Integration**: Use existing UI elements rather than creating new modals when possible.
- **Consistent API Patterns**: Match frontend API calls exactly to backend route structures.
- **Clear User Feedback**: Provide specific error messages and loading states for all operations.
- **Automatic State Management**: Clear selections and refresh displays automatically after successful operations.

### Important Implementation Details

- **Category Selection**: Use `querySelectorAll('.category-checkbox:checked')` to get selected categories.
- **Button State Management**: Always show loading states and disable buttons during API calls.
- **Error Handling**: Parse API response JSON for specific error messages rather than generic failures.
- **UI Refresh**: Update category displays immediately after assignment/removal operations.

### Next Steps & Considerations

- **Testing**: Verify all category operations work correctly across different browsers.
- **Performance**: Monitor API call performance with multiple category selections.
- **User Documentation**: Consider adding tooltips or help text for category selection workflow.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation works properly for category tree checkboxes.
