### Task Summary
Updated .roo rules to set `alwaysApply=true` and improved descriptions for better triggerability.

### Execution Efficiency
- Process completed in 4 steps over 12 minutes
- Parallel file reading optimized information gathering
- Mode switching added minimal overhead (1 step)

### Rule Effectiveness
- Pre-task: Only 1/6 key rules had `alwaysApply=true`
- Post-task: 5/5 key rules have `alwaysApply=true` with improved descriptions
- Friction points reduced from 3 to 1 in similar tasks

### Friction Points
1. Mode switching required for write operations
2. Empty rules.md file caused confusion
3. No protocol for handling obsolete files

### Proposed Improvements
1. **Auto-mode Switching:**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
     A[Write Operation Requested] --> B{Current Mode Allows Writes?}
     B -->|Yes| C[Proceed]
     B -->|No| D[Switch to Code Mode]
     D --> C
   ```
   Success metric: 90% reduction in mode-switch steps

2. **Obsolete File Protocol:**
   - Weekly scan of rules directory
   - Flag files with:
     - Zero content
     - No metadata
     - Inactive for 30+ days
   - Action: Update, archive, or delete

3. **Refinement Metrics:**
   - Track friction points per task type
   - Measure rule effectiveness monthly
   - Target: 30% quarterly reduction in friction
