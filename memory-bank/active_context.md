# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **UI Styling Overhaul for New Branding (Completed)**:
  - `templates/index.html` now fully aligns with the new dark, glassmorphic theme inspired by `templates/bulk_base.html` and defined in `tailwind.config.js`.
  - All static and dynamically generated elements, including category chips, reflect the new dark, glassmorphic theme.

## Recent Changes (During This Task)
- Updated `templates/base.html` body to dark gradient background.
- In `templates/index.html`:
    - Applied dark gradient background to `<body>`.
    - Styled the sidebar (`<aside>`) with `.glass-panel`, updated navigation link styles, and themed the product dropdown (`bg-gray-800/50 backdrop-blur-md`).
    - Styled static main content elements: product header, main "Category Management" card (`.glass-panel`), "Add Category" button (`bg-gradient-red`).
    - Styled "Add Category Form" containers (for Level 1, 2, 3 categories) with `.glass-panel` and themed search inputs.
    - Styled "Create New Category" card with `.glass-panel` and themed button.
    - Styled the "Category Creation Modal" with `.glass-panel` and themed form elements.
    - Updated the success message styling for the dark theme.
    - **Successfully updated JavaScript functions** (`createCategoryCard`, `getLevelColorClass`, `updateSelectedCategoriesDisplay`, `loadProductCategories`, `getLevelTextColorClass`) to apply glassmorphic styling to dynamic category chips.

## Next Steps
- Gather user feedback on the updated styling.
- Consider adding collapsible sections for category levels.
- Explore adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
- Investigate performance optimizations for large category sets.
- Plan for undo functionality in category operations.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The primary goal is to achieve a consistent dark, glassmorphic theme across the application, using `templates/bulk_base.html` as the main inspiration.
- The `.glass-panel` utility and `bg-gradient-red` are key components of this new branding.
- Styling for dynamically generated elements (category chips) is critical and needs to match the reference in `static/js/bulk-assign.js`.
- User feedback indicated contrast issues with the product dropdown and that category chips were not yet styled correctly prior to task interruption. This has now been addressed.

## Previous Context (Pre-Styling Task)
- UI Enhancement:
  - Added explicit level indicators (L1/L2/L3) to category chips
  - Implemented search functionality for each category level
  - Improved category chip layout with level badges
  - Enhanced mobile responsiveness for category selection
- Usability Improvements:
  - Added search filters to help users find categories quickly
  - Improved visual hierarchy with level badges
  - Optimized category chip layout for better readability
- Decided to add explicit level indicators to improve hierarchy recognition
- Chose to implement per-level search instead of global search for better context
- Maintained consistent color coding for levels (blue/red/green) for badges.
- Kept the category card interaction model while enhancing the visual design
- Balanced functionality with performance by only showing relevant search results
