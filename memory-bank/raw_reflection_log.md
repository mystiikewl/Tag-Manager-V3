TaskRef: "Memory Bank normalization kickoff + refactor preparation"

Learnings:
- The repository contains duplicate Memory Bank files with mixed naming conventions (snake_case and camelCase). Canonicalizing to camelCase improves consistency with existing files (productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md).
- The project is already production-ready per memory bank, but refactor goals target leaner, modular, and scalable architecture. Memory consolidation is a prerequisite to coordinate future changes and decisions.
- Key canonical set identified: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md, consolidated_learnings.md, raw_reflection_log.md.

Difficulties:
- Multiple similarly named files can cause context drift (e.g., project_brief.md vs projectbrief.md). Need a safe archival approach to avoid accidental loss of insights.
- One oddly named file "front-end-redesign,md" includes a comma; must review/merge or archive to prevent tooling issues.

Successes:
- Established a clear normalization plan and updated activeContext.md with the immediate next steps, refactor intent, duplicates to address, and repository observations.

Decisions:
- Use camelCase canonical naming for Memory Bank core documents (productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md) and keep projectbrief.md as top-level brief to match existing file in repo.
- Archive duplicates into memory-bank/_archive/2025-08-01/ after merging any unique content.

Planned Actions:
1) Merge duplicate memory-bank documents into canonical set and archive duplicates.
2) Update progress.md once normalization is complete.
3) Begin architecture inventory and propose a phased refactor roadmap.
