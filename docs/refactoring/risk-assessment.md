# Refactoring Risk Assessment

## Executive Summary

This document identifies, assesses, and provides mitigation strategies for risks associated with the Tag Manager V2 refactoring project. The goal is to ensure successful delivery while minimizing disruption to existing functionality.

## Risk Categories

### 1. Technical Risks

#### High Risk: Framework Migration (Flask to FastAPI)

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High | **Risk Level**: High

**Description**:

- Converting from Flask to FastAPI involves significant architectural changes
- Potential for breaking API changes that affect frontend integration
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with FastAPI patterns

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Conduct thorough API contract analysis before migration
- Implement gradual endpoint-by-endpoint migration
- Maintain Flask compatibility layer during transition
- Comprehensive testing of each migrated endpoint
- Team training on FastAPI patterns and Pydantic usage

#### Medium Risk: Database Migration (JSON to SQL)

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium | **Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**:

- Moving category data from JSON files to database
- Potential data loss or corruption during migration
- Changes to data access patterns throughout application

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Create comprehensive data backup before migration
- Develop migration scripts with rollback capability
- Validate data integrity at each migration step
- Test all data access patterns post-migration
- Implement gradual rollout with feature flags

#### Low Risk: Module Deduplication

**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: Medium | **Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**:

- Consolidating MSI and non-MSI module variants
- Potential for missing functionality in consolidated modules
- Import path changes affecting dependent modules

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Detailed analysis of differences between module variants
- Feature parity testing before deprecating old modules
- Gradual transition with both versions available
- Update imports systematically across codebase

### 2. Operational Risks

#### High Risk: Extended Downtime

**Probability**: Low | **Impact**: High | **Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**:

- Refactoring could introduce periods of system instability
- Potential for breaking changes affecting user workflows
- Team productivity impact during learning curve

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Implement feature flags for new functionality
- Schedule changes during low-usage periods
- Maintain rollback capability for all major changes
- Regular progress reviews and early warning systems

#### Medium Risk: Team Capability Gaps

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium | **Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**:

- Learning curve for new frameworks and patterns
- Potential knowledge gaps in testing methodologies
- Adaptation to new architectural patterns

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Provide training and resources for new technologies
- Pair programming during initial implementation
- Knowledge sharing sessions and documentation
- External expert consultation if needed

#### High Risk: Shopify API Dependencies (NEW)

**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High | **Risk Level**: High

**Description**:

- Complete dependency on Shopify API availability and performance
- API rate limiting could severely impact application responsiveness
- Changes to Shopify API could break integration without notice
- Authentication token management and security risks
- Data synchronization challenges between Shopify and local cache

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Implement comprehensive caching strategy with Redis/local storage
- Add exponential backoff and retry logic for API failures
- Monitor Shopify API status and subscribe to change notifications
- Maintain fallback to cached data on API failures (graceful degradation)
- Implement proper error handling and user notifications for API issues
- Set up alerts for API failures and rate limit thresholds
- Regular testing against Shopify API sandbox environment
- Maintain backup data synchronization strategy

### 3. Business Risks

#### High Risk: Scope Creep

**Probability**: High | **Impact**: Medium | **Risk Level**: High

**Description**:

- Refactoring could expand beyond planned scope
- Discovery of additional issues during implementation
- Pressure to add new features during refactoring

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Strict adherence to defined project scope
- Clear success criteria for each phase
- Regular stakeholder reviews to prevent scope drift
- Separate tracking for new feature requests

#### Medium Risk: Timeline Delays

**Probability**: High | **Impact**: Medium | **Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**:

- Underestimation of complexity in certain areas
- Unexpected technical challenges
- Resource constraints or availability issues

**Mitigation Strategies**:

- Build buffer time into phase estimates
- Regular progress monitoring and adjustment
- Early identification of bottlenecks
- Resource contingency planning

## Risk Monitoring and Control

### Risk Register Updates

- Update risk register weekly during refactoring
- Document new risks as they emerge
- Track mitigation effectiveness

### Early Warning Indicators

- Test failures increasing in frequency
- Team velocity dropping significantly
- Multiple blockers in same area
- Stakeholder concerns about progress

### Escalation Procedures

- **Low Risk**: Document and monitor in weekly reviews
- **Medium Risk**: Assign owner and mitigation plan within 1 week
- **High Risk**: Immediate escalation to project sponsor with action plan

## Contingency Planning

### Framework Migration Failure

**Trigger**: Critical issues with FastAPI migration
**Response**:

- Rollback to Flask with documented lessons learned
- Reassess timeline and approach
- Consider hybrid approach maintaining some FastAPI benefits

### Data Migration Failure

**Trigger**: Data corruption or significant loss during migration
**Response**:

- Restore from backup immediately
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Implement additional validation checks
- Consider alternative migration strategy

### Timeline Overrun

**Trigger**: Project falling behind schedule by >20%
**Response**:

- Conduct scope review and potential reduction
- Assess resource allocation and potential additions
- Implement overtime or extended timeline if critical
- Communicate transparently with stakeholders

### Shopify API Integration Failure

**Trigger**: Critical issues with Shopify API integration, rate limiting, or data synchronization
**Response**:

- Immediately switch to cached data mode for all operations
- Implement local data backup and synchronization strategy
- Set up alternative API access patterns (different rate limits)
- Consider temporary fallback to database-only mode
- Contact Shopify support for rate limit increases if applicable
- Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures
- Communicate service degradation to users with clear timeline

## Communication Plan

### Risk Communication

- **Internal Team**: Daily standups, weekly risk reviews
- **Stakeholders**: Bi-weekly progress reports with risk summary
- **Management**: Monthly steering committee updates

### Documentation Requirements

- All risks documented in risk register
- Mitigation plans for medium/high risks
- Risk status updates in project documentation
- Post-mortem analysis for realized risks

---

_This risk assessment will be updated throughout the refactoring project as new risks emerge and existing risks are mitigated or realized._
