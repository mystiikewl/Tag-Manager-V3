- [ ] Create comprehensive unit test coverage
- [ ] Implement integration tests for critical workflows
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ code coverage
- [ ] Add test utilities and fixtures

## Phase 5: Code Quality Enhancement (Week 13)

- [ ] Implement ESLint and Prettier
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Create comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Establish coding standards and style guide
- [ ] Add documentation for all modules and functions
- [ ] Set up automated linting in CI/CD

## Phase 6: Database Migration (Week 14-15)

- [ ] Design normalized database schema
- [ ] Create migration scripts for category data
- [ ] Move categories from JSON to database
- [ ] Update all data access patterns
- [ ] Add database indexes and constraints
- [ ] Test data integrity post-migration

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization (Week 16)

- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Optimize frontend bundle size
- [ ] Implement API response pagination where needed
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize critical user workflows

## Phase 8: Shopify API Integration (Week 17-20)

- [ ] Set up Shopify API client with authentication
- [ ] Implement product and tag synchronization
- [ ] Create tag group management via metafields
- [ ] Add caching layer with Redis/local storage
- [ ] Implement webhook handlers for real-time updates
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for API failures
- [ ] Test fallback to cached data scenarios
- [ ] Migrate existing data from database to Shopify
- [ ] Update all API endpoints to use Shopify as data source
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and retry logic
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for API issues

## Quality Gates

### End of Each Phase

- [ ] All tasks in phase completed
- [ ] Tests passing for implemented features
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Code review completed

### End of Project

- [ ] All phases completed successfully
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] All critical workflows tested
- [ ] API contracts documented and enforced
- [ ] State management consolidated
- [ ] Module duplication eliminated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation comprehensive and current

## Risk Management

### High Risk Items

- [ ] Framework migration (Flask to FastAPI)
- [ ] Module consolidation and deduplication
- [ ] Database migration with data integrity
- [ ] Large-scale refactoring without breaking changes

### Mitigation Strategies

- [ ] Gradual, incremental changes
- [ ] Comprehensive testing before/after changes
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Regular backups and rollback plans
- [ ] Feature flags for new implementations

## Communication Plan

### Weekly Updates

- [ ] Progress against checklist
- [ ] Blockers and risks identified
- [ ] Next week's priorities
- [ ] Key decisions made

### Phase Completion Reviews

- [ ] Demonstrate completed functionality
- [ ] Review test coverage and quality metrics
- [ ] Validate against success criteria
- [ ] Plan next phase activities

## Success Metrics

- **Timeline**: All phases completed within estimated timeframe
- **Quality**: Zero critical bugs in production
- **Performance**: API response times <200ms, bundle size optimized
- **Maintainability**: Clear code structure, comprehensive documentation
- **Testability**: 80%+ coverage, automated testing pipeline
- **User Experience**: All existing functionality preserved, improved responsiveness
